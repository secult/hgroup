Can you use QuickCheck?
Yes you could use quickcheck, but you would have to do some hacking:
- You would have to wrap the 'Grid' type synonym into a datatype with it's own constructor, 
  because instances do not work with Type synonyms.
- After this, you would have to make this datatype an instance of Arbitrary. 
    - Due to the constraints of a Grid (length, width, consistency, ...) you should provide your own Gen Grid
    - You can not do this with any of the functions provided in the week5 module, 
      because almost all of these use IO and this is not allowed in Arbitrary. 

So this basically means that using quickcheck would require you to either make your own sudoku generator and make that a Gen Grid
or replacing all of the IO monads in Week5 with Gen monads.

Since we can already generate random Sudoku problems and test this function, we do not use QuickCheck just for the sake of using QuickCheck.

{-The only problems we found with 4 or more empty blocks, were problems that looked like the following:

| 9 3 5 | 7 6 1 |       |
| 8 4 1 | 5 9 2 |       |

+-------+-------+-------+
|       |       |       |
|       |       |       |
|       |       |       |
+-------+-------+-------+
There could still be a possibility that a proper Sudoku with 4 empty blocks exists, however because we generate our problems randomly, finding this problem can take infinitely long. We were not prepared to wait that long, so we googled the answer: http://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/309/what-is-the-maximum-number-of-empty-3x3-blocks-a-proper-sudoku-can-have

--exercise 4 time spent: 1.5 hours (mostly analyzing week5 functions)

    Additional Formal specifications:
        Subgrids can overlap (the same rules apply other than that), 
        this means:
            let f be a function with:
                Domain: sudoku grid coordinates
                Codomain: sudoku subgrids + nrcSudoku subgrids
            
            for the nrcSudoku f is no longer injective as f may return 
            more than one subgrid for each coordinate.
            
            The consequence of this is that the constraint for the value 
            of a coordinate changes to:
                - the value must be unique in the row and column of the 
                  coordinate
                - the value must be unique in the Union of the 
                  coordinates of each subgrid the coordinate belongs to 
    
    Implementation:
        the only changing constraint is that subgrids can overlap 
        this change can be implemented as follows:
            - add nrcBlocks, which is the same as the blocks function, 
              but with the coordinates of the additional blocks in an 
              nrcSudoku
            - add function nrcbl, which is similar to bl, but uses 
              nrcBlocks
            - add function nrcSubGrid which is similar to subGrid, 
              but checks only the additional subgrids from the nrc sudoku
            - redefine the freeInSubgrid function to give back the 
              intersection of all free values in each subgrid of an 
              element
            - redefine consistent function to also check the nrcsudoku grid
            - redefine sameblock to also check nrcsudoku fields
              
        Additionally the following functionality has been added:
            - Added a control boolean nrcsudoku
                - If it is true, the program will use nrc sudokus
                - If it is false, the program will use regular sudokus
            - Added a nice way to show an nrc grid
            
    this has been implemented in the Week5 module provided as in this repo
    
    the solution of the nrc sudoku:
        +---------+-----------+---------+
        | 4   7 8 | 3   9   2 | 6 1   5 |
        |   +-----|---+   +---|-----+   |
        | 6 | 1 9 | 7 | 5 | 8 | 3 2 | 4 |
        | 2 | 3 5 | 4 | 1 | 6 | 9 7 | 8 |
        +---------+-----------+---------+
        | 7 | 2 6 | 8 | 3 | 5 | 1 4 | 9 |
        |   +-----|---+   +---|-----+   |
        | 8   9 1 | 6   2   4 | 7 5   3 |
        |   +-----|---+   +---|-----+   |
        | 3 | 5 4 | 9 | 7 | 1 | 2 8 | 6 |
        +---------+-----------+---------+

        | 9 | 8 3 | 1 | 4 | 7 | 5 6 | 2 |

-- exercise 5

{-- 
    By implementing the new constraints in exercise 4 the way that is described 
    above, the program is actually already able to generate nrc sudokus.
    
    Testing:
      - check if problem x (generated from y) is consistent
      - check if problem x (generated from y) is minimal
      - check if the solution for problem x (generated from y) is equal to y 
--}
	 
-- Exercise 6
{-- 
    This sudoku solver was based on the simple solver in the PelÃ¡nek paper mentioned in the exercise. 
    Although it is simplified due to shortage of time.
    
    it works like this:
    1 given a solution x, generate problem y from it
    2 try to solve problem y using two simple rules:
        - Naked value
        - Hidden single
    3 solved? great, the difficulty is 0
    4 stuck? get a hint, increase difficulty in step 3 by 1 and repeat from step 2
