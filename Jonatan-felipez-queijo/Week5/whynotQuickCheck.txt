Can you use QuickCheck?
Yes you could use quickcheck, but you would have to do some hacking:
- You would have to wrap the 'Grid' type synonym into a datatype with it's own constructor, 
  because instances do not work with Type synonyms.
- After this, you would have to make this datatype an instance of Arbitrary. 
    - Due to the constraints of a Grid (length, width, consistency, ...) you should provide your own Gen Grid
    - You can not do this with any of the functions provided in the week5 module, 
      because almost all of these use IO and this is not allowed in Arbitrary. 

So this basically means that using quickcheck would require you to either make your own sudoku generator and make that a Gen Grid
or replacing all of the IO monads in Week5 with Gen monads.

Since we can already generate random Sudoku problems and test this function, we do not use QuickCheck just for the sake of using QuickCheck.
